\description{
Propose the best signture based on benchamrk methods.
This function calculated the `metaIndex1` value which is the mean accuracy from train, test and validation dataset.
In the next step, it sorts the miRNA sets based on `metaIndex1` score. The first row in resulting data frame is the winner miRNA set.
}
\details{
@param benchmark_csv Path to benchmark csv.
 @param without_train One can argue, that accuracy on training dataset should not be used in calculation of metaIndex. By setting this to TRUE, you can calculate it without train dataset.

 @return The benchmark sorted by metaIndex. First row is the best performing miRNA set.
