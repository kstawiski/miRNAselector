ks.merge_formulas(wd = getwd(), max_miRNAs = 11, add = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{wd}{Working directory with formulas*.RDS files.}

\item{max_miRNAs}{Maximum number of miRNAs to be selected in formulas.}

\item{add}{List of additional sets that should be added to the formulas.}

\value{
Final formulas object, also save as `featureselection_formulas_final.RDS` in working directory.

\description{
Merge and filter formulas.
This function can be used to merge the formulas*.RDS created by different runs of `ks.miRNAselector()` and filter them to keep the maximum number of miRNAs.
This may be useful in planning qPCR validation.
The result of this function is `featureselection_formulas_final.RDS` file, which can be futher supplied to `ks.benchmark()`.
